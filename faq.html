    <h3 id="title">Title</h3>
    <p>
    Please give your project a descriptive name that captures interest and conveys its purpose. This
    will be used to identify the class in all official communications, including registration and IPRO Day.
    </p>

    <h3 id="problem-issue">Problem, Opportunity or Issue</h3>
    <p>
      Outline the problem, opportunity or issue you plan to address through the project and why it is important,
      interesting and meaningful. It is helpful to include perspectives on the state-of-the-art, the general topic
      area, relevant industries and key stakeholders. Please be as detailed as possible.<br><br>
      Here are some criteria for successful IPRO problem definition:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Open-ended problem:</b> The symptoms of the problem are clear (we can measure its impact on people 
            and organizations), but the root cause(s) have not been identified.</li>
        <li><b>No solution in mind:</b> The project requires exploring multiple solutions</li>
        <li><b>Stakeholder access:</b> It is possible to access and interact with the stakeholders. Students should 
            be able to interact with the people affected by the problem and those responsible for implementing 
            the solution.</li>
        <li><b>Technical AND social complexity:</b> The project involves both technical issues (can be resolved through
            technology) and social issues (can be resolved through communications, relationships, and learning).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
    <p>
      What is the goal of the project? What do you intend to achieve during the semester? Please note if you plan to phase your 
      goals across several semesters, and how you envision the team progressing through multiple phases, activities and tasks. 
      Please be as detailed as possible.<br><br>
        Although IPRO projects should have goals aligned with the nature of the problem, we expect that the solutions 
        developed by students will balance the following qualities: 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Desirable:</b> solves a key problem and creates value for a group of stakeholders / customers / users.</li>
	<li><b>Viable:</b> the solution is economically sustainable over time. </li>
	<li><b>Feasible:</b> the solution is achievable through existing technology, best demonstrated through working prototype. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>
    <p>
      How do you envision the team addressing the problem or issue? What methods / techniques / strategies do you anticipate that 
      the team will use? How are you going to support the team in involving stakeholders? How will you teach the course? <br><br>
        Although IPRO classes benefit from a diverse set of approaches, please remember that the following learning goals should 
        be addressed through your process: 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Teamwork:</b> How to be an effective member of an interdisciplinary team, adding the expertise of your
            discipline and working on topics broader than your major.</li>
	<li><b>Communication:</b> How to effectively communicate the technical and non-technical aspects of a project to key stakeholders.</li> 
	<li><b>Logically correct reasoning:</b> The ability to generate a hypothesis using inductive logic (leveraging design methods), 
            and then prove/disprove it using deductive logic (leveraging prototyping and analytical thinking).</li> 
	<li><b>Project management:</b> Deliver a desired, planned outcome with time and resource constraints.</li> 
	<li><b>Ethics:</b> How to act ethically when conducting research, working in teams, and creating solutions.</li> 
    </ul>
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3 id="dean">College Dean</h3>
    <p>
      Please select your college from the dropdown menu. Your proposal will first be reviewed and approved by your college dean or 
      her/is designated IPRO representative. 
    </p>
    <h3 id="sponsor">Sponsor Information</h3>
    <p>
      Many IPRO projects are sponsored and/or involve community partners or collaborating organizations. IPRO projects proposed by 
      adjuncts should involve a sponsoring organization that makes a financial commitment to the IPRO Program. If appropriate, please 
      tell us about the sponsor of the class. Remember, all partner organizations must sign an IPRO Collaboration Agreement. 
      Please work with Tom Jacobius to meet with the sponsoring organization and execute this agreement.
      <br><br>
      Remember that IIT undergraduate students own any intellectual property that they may create in their IPRO and other classes, 
      and students cannot sign non-disclosure agreements.
