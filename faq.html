    <p>
      Please give your project a descriptive name. Remember this will be used to identify the class in 
      all official communications, including registration and IPRO day. 
    </p>

    <h3 id="problem-issue">Problem or Issue</h3>
    <p>
      Outline the problem or issue you plan to address with the project. It is helpful to include the 
      general topic area or relevant industries and key stakeholders. Be sure to articulate why the problem 
      or issue is relevant and meaningful. Please be as detailed as possible.<br><br>
      Here are some criteria for successful IPRO problem definition:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Open-ended problem:</b> The symptoms of the problem are clear (we can measure its impact on people 
            and organizations), but the root cause(s) have not been identified.</li>
        <li><b>No solution in mind:</b> The project requires exploring multiple solutions</li>
        <li><b>Stakeholder access:</b> It is possible to access and interact with the stakeholders. Students should 
            be able to interact with the people affected by the problem and those responsible for implementing 
            the solution.</li>
        <li><b>Technical AND social complexity:</b> The project involves both technical issues (can be resolved through
            technology) and social issues (can be resolved through communications, relationships, and learning).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
    <p>
      What is the goal of the project? What do you intend to achieve during the semester? Please note if you 
      plan to phase you goals across several semesters (if you imagine the project lasting more that one semester). 
      Please be as detailed as possible. <br><br>
        Although IPRO projects should have goals aligned with the nature of the problem, we expect that the solutions 
        developed by students will balance the following qualities: 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Desirable:</b> solves a key problem and creates value for a group of stakeholders / customers / users.</li>
	<li><b>Viable:</b> the solution is economically sustainable over time. </li>
	<li><b>Feasible:</b> the solution is achievable through existing technology, best demonstrated through working prototype. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>
    <p>
      How do you plan on addressing the problem or issue? What methods / techniques / strategies do you plan to use? How are you
      going to involve the stakeholders? How will you teach the course? <br><br>
        Although IPRO classes benefit from a diverse set of approaches, please remember that the following learning goals should 
        be addressed through your process: 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Teamwork:</b> How to be an effective member of an interdisciplinary team, adding the expertise of your
            discipline and working on topics broader than your major.</li>
	<li><b>Communication:</b> How to effectively communicate the technical and non-technical aspects of a project to key stakeholders.</li> 
	<li><b>Logically correct reasoning:</b> The ability to generate a hypothesis using inductive logic (leveraging design methods), 
            and then prove/disprove it using deductive logic (leveraging prototyping and analytical thinking).</li> 
	<li><b>Project management:</b> Deliver a desired, planned outcome with time and resource constraints.</li> 
	<li><b>Ethics:</b> How to act ethically when conducting research, working in teams, and creating solutions.</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3 id="sponsor">Sponsor Information</h3>
    <p>
      Many IPRO projects are sponsored. All IPRO projects taught by adjuncts need to be sponsored. Please tell us about the sponsor of the
      class. Remember, all partner organizations must sign an IPRO agreement letter. Please work with Tom Jacobius to execute this agreement. <br><br>
      Remember that IIT undergraduate students cannot sign non-disclosure agreements and own the intellectual property they create in class.
